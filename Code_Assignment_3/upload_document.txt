### Method Name ###

cipherword word2vec + Self-Attention

### Representation of sentence ###

Trained a word2vec on only cipherword text. Concatenate all word embeddings to represent a sentence.

### Classifier ###

First, train a word2vec to embedding a sentence. Second, using self-attention model with TransformerEncoder layer. Then, do dimension reduction to 1d and use sigmoid function.

### Training & Development ###

Compare the rounding number from output to ground truth label. Binary cross entropy, SGD are the loss function and optimizer. Learning rate = 0.01. Terminate the training when going through all the training data.

### Other methods ###

LSTM.

### Packages ###

Pytorch
